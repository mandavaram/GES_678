I'm currently working as an application developer using Microsoft .NET technologies and interested in GIS development like web based Esri geospatial applications. My goal is to learn and improve skill set in GIS technologies and Spatial analysis. I'm very confident that the course: GES 678 - GIS Project Leadership and Management, will help and improve my skill set advanced study and application of structured analysis and design methods throughout the GIS life cycle. The course stresses common approaches for gathering requirements, modeling, analyzing and designing geographic information systems. The course employs the case method of instruction.
