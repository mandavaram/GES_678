I'm currently working as an application developer using Microsoft .NET technologies and interested in GIS development like web based Esri geospatial applications. My goal is to learn and improve skill set in GIS technologies and Spatial analysis. I'm very confident that the course: GES 678 - GIS Project Leadership and Management, will help and improve my skill set advanced study and application of structured analysis and design methods throughout the GIS life cycle. The course stresses common approaches for gathering requirements, modeling, analyzing and designing geographic information systems. The course employs the case method of instruction.

Creating a GitHub site to showcase the skills and knowledge gained from the MPS (Master of Professional Studies) program provides several significant benefits:

**Professional Portfolio:** GitHub site can serve as a dynamic and comprehensive professional portfolio. It's a centralized location where I can display my projects, code, data analyses, and other work, allowing potential employers and collaborators to assess my skills and expertise easily.

**Visible Skill Development:** Through my GitHub repositories, I can showcase the progression of my skills and knowledge over time. This visibility can demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and improvement, which is highly valued in today's rapidly evolving job market.

**Evidence of Problem-Solving:** By sharing my class assignments and projects on GitHub, I provide concrete evidence of my ability to tackle real-world problems. Employers and peers can review my code and documentation to assess my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.

**Showcasing Specific Skills:** Tailor my GitHub repositories to highlight specific skills or technologies learned during my MPS program. Whether it's data analysis, machine learning, web development, or GIS, I can categorize and showcase projects related to my desired career path.

**Networking Opportunities:** GitHub is a hub for developers, data scientists, and professionals from various fields. By actively sharing my work and engaging with the GitHub community, I can connect with like-minded individuals, potential mentors, and future collaborators.

In summary, a well-curated GitHub site can be a powerful tool for showcasing my skills, knowledge, and professional growth during my MPS program. It not only helps me stand out to potential employers but also fosters ongoing learning, collaboration, and networking opportunities in my chosen field.
